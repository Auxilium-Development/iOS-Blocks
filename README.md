### What is iOS Blocks? ###

iOS Blocks is a widget-like system for iOS. It was originally designed by Jay Machalani for a project called "Pushing iOS", a more detailed explanation of the project can be found <a href="http://jaymachalani.com/blog/2014/5/29/pushing-ios">here</a>. iOS Blocks was originally developed largely by Matt Clarke with a few others, after about a year and a half the project got tiring so it was open-sourced in the hopes that a future developer would finish the project. In 2016 a tweak development team called Creatix picked up the project and is working on bringing it to completition. iOS Blocks is currently aiming to support iOS 7 - 9.3.3 on all iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touches.

### How do I get set up? ###

There's no massive dependancies, although you may need to grab the same set of headers I'm using if you hit annoying compiling stuff. If so, I'll send the .zip of them your way.

It links against UIKit and Foundation, so nothing out of the ordinary.

### Bugs ###

Editing mode is borked for all devices. It's an issue within the code for determining where icons should go AFAIK.# iOS-Blocks
