iOS Blocks.

Curago is being used as a name here since it was a abandoned project with a premise very similar ot this one. Figured it still fitted, as curago means "manage"/"take charge".

### How do I get set up? ###

There's no massive dependancies, although you'll need to create a makefile to get this working unfortunately. :(

It links against UIKit and Foundation, so nothing out of the ordinary.

### Bugs ###

Editing mode is borked for all devices. It's an issue within the code for determining where icons should go AFAIK.
