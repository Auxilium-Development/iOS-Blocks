### What is iOS Blocks? ###

iOS Blocks is a widget-like system for iOS. It was originally designed by Jay Machalani. iOS Blocks aims to remove the need to open an application everytime the end user wants to do something like check stocks or take a photo, Jay Machalani outlined this pretty well in a detailed blog post you can find <a href="http://jaymachalani.com/blog/2014/5/29/pushing-ios">here</a>.

### How do I get set up? ###

There's no massive dependancies, although you may need to grab the same set of headers I'm using if you hit annoying compiling stuff. If so, I'll send the .zip of them your way.

It links against UIKit and Foundation, so nothing out of the ordinary.

### Bugs ###

Editing mode is borked for all devices. It's an issue within the code for determining where icons should go AFAIK.# iOS-Blocks
